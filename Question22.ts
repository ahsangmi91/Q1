//More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of the following:

//Tests using the lower case function
console.log(`Is x[2] equal to "Buses" (case-insensitive)? I predict true.`);
console.log(x[2].toLowerCase() == "buses");
